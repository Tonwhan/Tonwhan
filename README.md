> ⭐ I want to be Product Engineer
I’m learning to build products that are useful, usable, and meaningful.

## My Product Mindset
I don’t just want to code features.  
I want to understand:
- Who is this for?
- What problem does it solve?
- Why would someone use it?

Because great products are built with empathy, clarity, and purpose — not just code.
